# How to add a Node
If you want to add the node to this list, feel free to create a pull request and
add in the file nodes.json something similar like the following code:

    {
      "name": "NAME OF YOUR NODE",
      "domain": "DOMAIN or IP ADDRESS",
      "port": "PORT",
      "contact": "YOUR NAME <email@domain.tld>",
      "url": "URL FOR MORE INFO",
      "notes": "spaces for a small description or some notes",
      "location": "LOCATION OF THE NODE"
    },

With these information we can provide a better information to the miners, 
allowing them to connect to the best node available. The more information the 
better it will be.
